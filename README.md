## ✨ Features

### 📚 Two-Phase Wealth System

- **L2 - Goal-Based Savings**: Custom goals (vacation, car, house down payment)

#### **Phase 2: Retirement (3-Bucket Strategy)**
Protection against sequence-of-returns risk:

- **B1 - Spending**: 3 years expenses (safe, liquid funds)
- **B2 - Stability**: 3 years expenses (debt/hybrid funds)

## 💡 Key Principles

### Prerequisites (Must Have First!)
✅ **Term Life Insurance** (20-30x annual expenses)
✅ **Health Insurance** (₹10L+ family floater)
✅ **No High-Interest Debt** (credit cards, personal loans paid off)

### The Waterfall Rule
Money only flows to the next level when the current level is full. This ensures financial stability before taking risks.

### Goal-Based L2
Unlike traditional emergency funds, L2 is **not a fixed amount**. It's the sum of your specific goals. No goals = ₹0 in L2.

### Tax-Optimized Choices
- **15%+ bracket**: Arbitrage funds save 2.5-17.5% tax vs liquid funds
- **5-10% bracket**: Either works, liquid funds are simpler
- **0% bracket (rebate)**: All options are tax-free, use simplest

### Retirement Safety
The 3-bucket system protects you from selling equity in a bear market. With 6 years of expenses in B1+B2, you can wait out market downturns.
